# Technical-Requirement-Document-Business-Intelligence

Hi, my name is Jopi Adrianto Doloksaribu, thank you for passing by. 
Welcome to myportfolio, here you would find a Technical Requirement Document that i and my partner made during business intelligence bootcamp with Binar institution.
The botcamp took 2 introductory plus 3 intensive months to go through business intelligence engineering from beginning.
The TRD is presented in pdf document i attached [here](https://github.com/adjopi20/Technical-Requirement-Document-Business-Intelligence/blob/main/TRD_Superstore_Apriandi-Jopi.docx%20(1).pdf).
In this bootcamp we mainly used SQL as the language. The query was written in Google BigQuery. Furthermore, the datasets was given by Binar in the form of csv files.

Should you have any enquiry feel free to email [me](mailto: jopi.adrianto@gmail.com)

Thank you!
